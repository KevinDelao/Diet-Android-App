## Introduction Calorie Fragment:
The purpose of the Calorie Counter Fragment is to provide a way for users to register what they have eaten throughout the day and track at
what time they ate to ensure that users know what they are eating to promote healthier living.

## Motivation:
Most diet apps restrict you on what you can track and sometimes provide too many options on what to track for certain foods, the calorie fragment is meant to provide a very simple way for users to enter what they ate and record at what time of the day they ate in order to provide a simple tracking of calories.

## Code style:

Kotlin was used to make all the files associated with the calorie fragment

## Features:
The calorie fragment provides a easy to use interface that allows users to simply to click on a button that takes them to a entry
point and lets users enter what they ate and then see at what time the food was eaten.
